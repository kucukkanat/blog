# Slaps the keyboard, pets the mouse

Hi, 
I am Tolga, a web developer from Amsterdam. I live in a constant state of *curious*.
I slap the keyboard and pet the mouse everyday. My code is poetry, meanwhile their's is oh-noetry.

### I :black_heart: (love) : 
Anything on command line, Git, Mechanical keyboards, Javascript, anything portable, guitars, sailboats

### I :rage: (hate) :
That new framework, excuses for bad code
